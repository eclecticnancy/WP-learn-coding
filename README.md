This is the sample code for WordPress: Learn By Coding by Scott Hughes.

There are folders for each chapter with source code. Each folder includes the files that were updated during that chapter in their final form for that chapter. The only exception to this are the PHP chapters, which are numbered step by step.

You'll also find a "wpbook2" folder. This contains the initial version of the second theme that we build on in the book. I've included this just in case they change the underscores theme too much.

You will be able to buy the book on Amazon soon.
